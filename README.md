# Driving & Vehicle License Department (DVLD) System

The DVLD Management System is a Windows Forms-based desktop application designed to manage driving license operations, including applications, renewals, and verifications. Built using a clean 3-tier architecture (Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Access Layer), this system ensures a modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a Three-Tier Architecture, comprising:

1. Presentation Layer – User Interface for interaction  
2. Business Logic Layer – Handles the core functionality and rules  
3. Data Access Layer – Manages database interactions
